# training-v2

This README file contains a list of all exercises in this training module.

Each exercise in contained within a partucilar branch which are named
consecutively e.g. "ex_1".

Exercises are arranged such that each builds upon the previous, so completing
them in order is essential. 

Each exercise may contain multiple tasks, and may require multiple files. 
Instructions for naming files will be given so please adhere to them. This
is so that practice conforming to a given development standard can be practised, 
emulating the development experience. 

To complete an exercise, move on to the relevant branch with the following
command;

    git checkout <branchName>

There is no need to make any new branches, either by branching from main 
or from another branch.

Once an exercise has been completed, please add, commit and push to GH using the 
following commands;

    git add .
    git commit -m"commit message"
    git push
